This is my challenge to a rapid prototype. A PC starter.

Well. what do you do if you have a smart plug and a PC you wish to turn on remotely? You can't just plug the PSU to the plug, corruption risk. 

This is what the starter circuit does. It generates a pulse on the power button, optically isolated designed to only allow turning on not other way (turning off smart plug, well your PC still runs).
